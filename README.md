This repository contains my **learning exercises and practice programs** in Data Science and Machine Learning using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
These notebooks helped me understand data analysis, visualization, and basic machine learning concepts.
# Notebooks Included
- Titanic EDA – Exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset
- Accident Data Analysis – Basic analysis and visualization of accident data
- Population Histogram – Visualization of population data
- Bank Decision Tree Classifier – Decision tree classifier for banking dataset
# Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
> These are **practice notebooks**, created as part of my learning journey in Data Science.
